# Build Roulette - a [Netlify Extension](https://sdk.netlify.com) to kill more than the time while deploying

Spin the wheel for a 1-in-6 chance of having your in-progress deploy canceled!

## Make Your Own Game

Delete all the files from the `src/components` directory and start building your own game from scratch. The file you will name `Game.tsx` will be the main file for your game.

Before the launch of the game directory, you will need to add yourself to the feature flag to test games in the Netlify app. The feature flag is called `site_build_game_surface`.

**Remember to test in dark mode! And light mode!**

## Publish
